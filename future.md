# Ideas for future enhancements

- Visual field addition controls (button/dropdown to add fields)
    - Basic control type selection UI
    - Validation rules (required, min/max length, regex patterns)
    - Display options (labels, descriptions, placeholder text)
    - Conditional visibility (show/hide based on other fields)
    - Custom layout options (columns, accordions)
- Form templates gallery
- Import bundle functionality
- Export to different formats
- Built-in help/documentation
- Collaborative features
- Form testing/submission simulation
